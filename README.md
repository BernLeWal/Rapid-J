# Rapid/J
A machine-learning network based on self-constructing graphs of neurons during the supervised learning process.
The interconnected neurons implement algebrahic-functions for evaluating the weights and firing functions.

(**Rapid/J** = **R**apid **A**lgebrahic self-**P**rogramming with **I**ncremental **D**eductions / implemented in **J**ava)

## Goals / specific features:
* network/graph is built-up during learning
* needs only mimimum of learning-data
* network/graph is self optimizing
* neuronal-network function is transparent; GraphML export
* (neurons are working independently (the final goal) )
* (data/information is passing "as waves" through the network/graph)

Attention: work in progress - project is in an early stage.

## Getting started:
1. Clone the whole repository
2. Open the Project in NetBeans
3. Run SkalarTestSuite.java in test/rapid/net/skalar

## HOWTO: program your own neural-network
1. open test/rapid/net/Numbers123Test.java
2. follow the instructions inside the source-file
